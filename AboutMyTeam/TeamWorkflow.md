# Team Workflow

## Team Members
1. Nitiphum (6033) – Quick Sort (Python)
2. Kittipot (5891) – Sorting Feature

## Branch Strategy
- main: Stable production branch (no direct commits)
- Nitiphum_6033: Feature branch for Nitiphum
- Kittipot_5891: Feature branch for Kittipot

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Clone the team repository
Each member clones the same GitHub Classroom repository.

### 2. Create Your Own Feature Branch
Each member creates a branch named:
- Nitiphum_6033
- Kittipot_5891

### 3. Work Inside Your Branch Only
All source code must be inside the **Project/** folder.

### 4. Commit and Push Changes
Each member commits only to their own branch.

### 5. Create Pull Request (PR)
When the work is ready, create a PR from your branch → main.

### 6. Code Review
Team members review each other's work.
Fix issues if needed.

### 7. Merge to main
After approval, merge to main.

### 8. Resolve Conflicts Together
If conflicts occur during merge, the team works together to fix them.

## Hotfix Workflow (Optional)
If a bug is detected in main, create a branch:
hotfix-<version>
Then fix the issue and merge back.
